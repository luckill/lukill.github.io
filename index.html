    <h1>Real Analysis</h1>
    <p>In mathematics, the branch of real analysis studies <strong>behavior of real numbers, sequences and series of real numbers, and real functions.</strong>  Some particular 
        properties of real-valued sequences and functions that real analysis studies include <strong>limits, continuity, smoothness, differentiability and integrability.</strong>
        Real analysis is distinguished from complex analysis, which deals with the study of complex numbers and their functions.</p>
